  Challenge 02: Node.js Concepts
</h3>

## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, an application was developed to train the concepts learned so far in Node.js during the Bootcamp GoStack 11 promoted by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/)!

This will be an application to store repositories in your portfolio, which will allow the creation, listing, update and removal of the repositories, and also allow the repositories to receive "likes".

More info about the challenge you can find [here](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafios/tree/master/desafio-conceitos-nodejs).
